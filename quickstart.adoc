=== Projects

{jgitver-doc}[jgitver] is composed by:

- {jgitver-lib}[jgitver library]: a java library using git that computes a git repository version based on a given configuration
- {jgitver-maven-plugin}[jgitver maven plugin]: a maven core extension allowing to compute POM versions without any effort or `pom.xml` modification
- {jgitver-gradle-plugin}[jgitver gradle plugin]: a gradle plugin allowing to compute gradle project version

As it is always good to _eat your own food_, all the above projects self-use either the {jgitver-maven-plugin}[jgitver maven plugin] or {jgitver-gradle-plugin}[gradle one] ; thus you can look at them as examples.
