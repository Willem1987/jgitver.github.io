== Modes

{jgitver-doc}[jgitver] provides different ways of computing version called _'modes'_ or _'strategies'_. Each mode comes with some behavior, defaults and configuration capabilities.

=== maven mode

[TIP]
====
The maven mode is built to reflect maven way of versioning: SNAPSHOTs and RELEASEs
====


In this mode _(which is the default mode of the jgitver maven plugin)_, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] will:

- on a DETACHED HEAD having an annotated tag, use the tag name without further computation : _mean to release_
- add SNAPSHOT qualifier to the calculated version each time it is not in the previous state : _everything is a SNAPSHOT except a release_
- increase the patch version except if it comes from a lightweight tag : _mean to start a new version pattern numbering_
- use annotated tags before lightweight ones when on a DETACHED HEAD : _reproducible builds for release_
- use lightweight tags before annotated ones when on a normal branch (master or any other branch) : _start 'next' version after release_
- add a branch qualifier on purpose : _avoid version collision for feature branches_

=== default mode

[TIP]
====
The default mode is built to reflect a standard way of versioning, each commit being uniquely identified.
====

In this mode _(which is the default mode of the jgitver gradle plugin)_, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] will:

* on a DETACHED HEAD having an annotated tag, use the tag name without further computation
* use annotated tags before lightweight ones when on a DETACHED HEAD
* use lightweight tags before annotated ones when on a normal branch (master or any other branch)
  - exception is when HEAD is on current branch, lightweight tags have precedence only when the repository is dirty
* add a branch qualifier on purpose

=== pattern mode

[TIP]
====
This mode allows some freedom to the project owner. As a project maintainer you define/configure your own pattern of versioning.
====

[WARNING]
====
The pattern mode is new in jgitver-0.7.0 and is to be considered as beta feature.
====

In this mode, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] computes some metadatas that can be used in a pattern definition, provided by configuration, to compute the final version.

[NOTE]
====
this section needs enhancements. Partial information can be found in https://github.com/jgitver/jgitver/issues/33#issuecomment-350811654[jgitver#33].

== Maven configuration

include::includes.adoc[tag=wip]

see the https://github.com/jgitver/jgitver-maven-plugin[jgitver-maven-plugin] project
https://github.com/jgitver/jgitver-maven-plugin/blob/master/README.md[README] until the doc is enhanced.

== Gradle configuration

include::includes.adoc[tag=wip]

see the https://github.com/jgitver/gradle-jgitver-plugin[gradle-jgitver-plugin] project
https://github.com/jgitver/gradle-jgitver-plugin/blob/master/README.md[README] until the doc is enhanced.

== IDEs usage

By providing dynamic versioning, {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] is not currently the best friend of IDEs.
Please refer to the instructions of your preferred IDE and if you need project dependency within the IDE then look
at the latest paragraph.

=== Eclipse

{jgitver-doc}[jgitver] works out of the box inside Eclipse.
Just import your project as would do normally.

=== Intellij IDEA

Unfortunately, Intellij IDEA still does notwork out of the box when {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] is there.
The problem has been reported to Intellij under the following issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-187928[IDEA-187928].

To workaround Intellij failure, you have to deactivate {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] for the import step.
For maven projects for example, open the settings `CTRL+ALT+S` and modify imports settings by adding `-Djgitver.skip=true`
as in the below image.

=== Netbeans

{jgitver-doc}[jgitver] works out of the box inside Netbeans.
Just import your project as would do normally.
